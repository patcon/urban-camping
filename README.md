> Because every silly idea is slightly less silly when it has a hashtag.

This is a place to log my efforts to live as minimally as possible in a
metropolitan city like Toronto.

This will be purely a warm-weather activity. If I wish to continue
during Canadian winter, I'll be doing it elsewhere.

**The rationale** is so that I can spend less time working for others,
and more time working on the things I feel are important, but which may
or may not have market value. Also, if I can learn to live comfortably
in my homelessness, what many consider the failing condition of western
society, then I can hopefully conduct my life more fearlessly.

### Format

I'll log ongoing goals and intentions as issues, and track details of
longer term items or established habits [in the
wiki](https://github.com/patcon/urban-lifestyle-camping/wiki).
