# \#UrbanLifestyleCamping

> Because every silly idea is slightly less silly when it has a hashtag.

This is a place to log my efforts to live as minimally as possible in a
metropolitan city. The rationale is so that I can spend less time
working for others, and more time working on the things I feel are
important, but which may or may not have market value.

### Format

I'll log ongoing goals and intentions as issues, and track details of
longer term items or established habits in the wiki.
